Workflow:
- create dummy data to experiment with chart
- write d3 chart as script that is loaded in index.html file
- transform Javascript script to function:
  - in index.html file:
    - select canvas
    - set customized parameters
    - load data
  - in function:
    - set default parameters, create access functions
    - remove data loading
    - create inner function: based on selection and data
- create Julia API:
  - save data to disk 
  - alternatively: directly write data to Javascript code
  - TODO: print warning that data is written to disk
  - load data in Javascript
  - forward chart options to Javascript
  - call chart
  - return full Javascript code
  - TODO: include CSS somehow
